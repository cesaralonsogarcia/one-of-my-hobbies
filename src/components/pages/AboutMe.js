            I am an Electrical Engineer with 11 years of professional experience
            currently working for Heads Up Technologies. Most of my experience
            is in PCB design for enterprise servers. However, I also have
            experience within the transportation industry, the medical device
            industry, and the aviation industry.

            I am based out of Dallas, TX. When I was in college at St. Mary's
            University in San Antonio, TX., I finished several programming
            classes since I was not sure if I wanted to be a Software Engineer
            or an Electrical Engineer. I almost completed a double major degree,
            but I decided to stay in the Electrical Engineering path.

            After several years, I finally decided to look for a way to get more
            proficient in Web Development so I decided to join the SMU Full
            Stack Developer Bootcamp. I really enjoy coding and developing
            websites. Feel free to take a look at some of my most recent
            creations!
